			<p> There’s a common joke around the National Football League that before the season, every fanbase will talk itself into believing their team can win 10 games.The Athletic proved that true before this season, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5740842/2024/09/04/nfl-fans-predictions-rankings-hope/?source=user_shared_article">publishing an article</a> that showed almost two-thirds of fanbases were at least 70% optimistic. The NFL is the most popular league in the world and it isn’t very close. The phrase “Any Given Sunday” resonates with so many fans because it’s true. On average, more than one last place finisher each season goes on to win its division the next year. On any Sunday, anything can happen. Yet, there's a strong trend across the league that the teams who win are the ones with the easiest schedules. 
 </p>


			<h3>Super Bowl Champions Never Have The Toughest Schedules</h3>

			<p>Since the NFL finished expansion in 2002 and settled with its current divisional format, four divisions in each conference consisting of four teams, 13 teams have won the Super Bowl. None of them have done it with one of the eight hardest schedules in football. The league creates its schedule in a way that the best teams from the year before are expected to have the toughest slate for the next season. </p> 
			<p> Despite all of this, each year the team that wins the biggest game didn’t have the hardest path. That didn’t come as a surprise to Pro Football Focus Data Collection Analyst Mason Kinnahan, “I think there's just so many teams that can be really great one year and then suck the next year, whether that's just lack of off-season moves or mismanagement.”

<h3>Washington’s Preseason Expectations For The 2024 Season</h3>
			<!-- Add image below this comment -->

			<p>As a result of this parity, anything can happen. However, this year, the expectations around the Washington Commanders were very low. FanDuel’s preseason win total was just 6.5 – tied for 3rd lowest in the NFC. That’s exactly where Kinnahan thought the team would be, “I thought the ceiling of the team here was probably eight, nine wins, and they're already at that. I had them being like a six-win team.” </p>

<p> The Commander's schedule was tied for the 7th hardest in the conference entering the year. As the season has gone on though, as expected in the league, things have changed. The team has had the easiest schedule in the league this season. In addition to the quality of opponent being lower than expected, Kinnahan thinks that the lack of travel has played a big role in Washingtons success this season, “They only play three games that are not in the eastern time zone. So that is massive for the team, making sure the team stays in a rhythm… the schedule makers were definitely very easy on the Commanders this year.” </p>

<p> Four of Washington’s five losses this season are to teams currently in the playoffs. The team doesn’t have a single win over a team that would make the playoffs if the season ended today. The Commanders have struggled against the league’s best this season. Kinnahan stressed the need for Washington to beat a high-caliber opponent as it could show they, “Can compete against the big dogs in the NFC, could win a playoff game or two and actually make a potential run in the in the NFC playoffs.” </p>

			<h3>Washington Historically Only Plays Well With Easy Schedules</h3>
			<p> Since 2002, the Washington NFL franchise has primarily found success when facing easier schedules. According to Pro Football Focus’s Strength of Schedule (SOS) rating—which uses the Simple Rating System (SRS) to measure the average quality of opponents (with 0 representing an average team)—Washington’s better seasons have coincided with favorable schedules. When you compare it to the team's biggest rival, the Dallas Cowboys, it shows how Dallas has been able to win divisions with hard schedules, unlike Washington.

			<h3>How It Relates To This Season</h3>
			<p>The Commanders have been able to take advantage of the easiest schedule in the NFL this season. The team has its best record through 14 games since 1992 and has secured it’s first winning season since 2016. Just like many Super Bowl champions in the past, the team didn’t have the toughest path but history has proven that isn’t necessary to win a championship. </p>

<p> One thing that is important though heading into the final weeks of the season is that the team finishes strong. With matchups against two sub .500 teams (Atlanta Falcons and Philidelphia Eagles) to end the season, Kinnahan stressed the importance of a winning streak heading into the postseason, “You want to gain a lot of momentum going into the playoffs, no matter who you beat, if you're on a five game winning streak going into that wild card game, that's huge.” </p> 

<p> Before Washington plays two easier opponents to end its season, it takes on Philadelphia this Sunday who’s currently tied for the 2nd best record in the league. A chance to knock off one of the leagues best could silence the talk of the Commanders only beating bad teams, however Kinnahan doesn’t buy that narrative, “As long as they get the job done against the easier teams, we'll see what happens against Philly. With the Falcons and then Dallas running out the season, I think to pick at least two wins in a row before heading into the playoffs would be huge for Washington.”
